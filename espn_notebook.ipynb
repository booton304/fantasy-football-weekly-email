      "The top player this week goes to none other than Mr. John Qian, the \"Real Artist\" in this game of gambles. With 109 points this week, he is sitting pretty at an undefeated 3-0 record. Dare I say a masterpiece of a season so far? Keep splashing those points onto your season, Picasso.\n",

      "Keeping an iron grip on the #2 spot we have Andrew Kim's \"King Drew.\" Undeniably - the king is not ready to abdicate his throne just yet. Three weeks in, three wins and not ready to slow down. Why be a prince when you can be a king, right Andrew?\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest shock this week comes from \"MackDarnolds chicken nuggets\", owned by Francis Jin. We should have seen it coming; the power of nugget magic can only take one so far in fantasy football. Francis, maybe it's time to swap those nuggets for some solid steak. Better luck next week!\n",
      "\n",
      "But the spotlight of shame this week again shines brightest on Richie Kay and his utterly heartbreaking team \"Richie's ㄱㅅㄲ s\". Three weeks in and still no W? Richie, my man, the last time I saw such a tragic performance was when a cat walked across my keyboard trying to send an email. On the bright side, there’s only one direction to move from rock bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "And with a heavy sigh, we must pass over John Dong's \"Big Cheese.\" It seems the Cheese has spoiled, or perhaps been left out in the sun. With a 1-2 record and a weak 87 points this week, the cheese is definitely not standing alone at the top. However, I've seen moldier performances turned around. Who knows, when the cheese ages, it might just get better (sounds gross metaphorically, but stay with me here).\n",
